# About:
#     This generator creates a random level 1 character for Black Hack and Rad-
#     Hack using the flavorful character traits from Maze Rats and names 
#     borrowed from free online fantasy name generators.
#
#     Names, traits, class, abilities, wealth, equipment, and spells are all
#     randomly generated according to the character guidelines given in their
#     respective sources. For instance, Black Hack classes (warrior, thief,
#     cleric, conjurer) will have their ability scores generated via 3d6,
#     while Rad-Hack humans will use 4d6 and drop lowest, mutants a d20, robots
#     a 27 point-buy, and psionics a mix of 3d6 for physical stats and 4d6 drop
#     lowest for mental stats. Equipment is purchased according to random
#     starting wealth, generally beginning with a weapon and armor and using
#     leftover money to purchase other things.
#
#     This generator was created to provide my players with fun 'anything goes'
#     characters for a deadly adventure in the dungeon of Kihago ("Beneath the
#     Ruins" by Alex Fotinakes published in the "Wizards Mutants Lazer Pistols"
#     OSR fan-zine). Rest in peace, Photoserpent the Cleric, killed by a laser
#     blast followed shortly by an eruption of a billion parasitic worms
#     from your egg-infested corpse. I dedicate this generator to your memory.
#
#
# How to use:
#     Place RandomGonzoHack.py, RandomGonzoNames.py, and RandomGonzoDesc.py in
#     a single directory, then run RandomGonzoHack.py
#
#
# Any future work would be aimed at:
#     Adding an option to include randomly-generated Maze Rats spells
#     Formatting output to look pretty
#     Overall condensing and cleanup of code
